# Introduction

AppleBlox is a native macOS launcher for Roblox with advanced customization options, performance controls, and quality-of-life improvements.

## Features

Mac users have had limited options for enhancing their Roblox experience compared to Windows users with tools like Bloxstrap. AppleBlox brings similar functionality to macOS.

**Custom Mods** replace Roblox's textures, UI elements, and sounds. Install texture packs, modify interfaces, or change sound effects. The mod system supports both minimalist changes and complete visual overhauls.

**Discord Rich Presence** shows your Roblox activity on Discord. Your friends can see what game you're playing and how long you've been online. Enable the join button to let friends connect to your game directly through Discord.

**Multi-Instance Support** lets you run multiple Roblox windows at once. This is useful for managing multiple accounts, testing games during development, or trading between your own accounts.

**FastFlags Editor** provides access to Roblox's internal configuration system. You can unlock FPS limits, adjust graphics rendering settings, and modify network behavior using the same flags that Roblox developers use.

**Icon Customization** changes the AppleBlox app icon. Choose from the built-in library or upload your own .icns files.

**Custom Themes** modify AppleBlox's interface using CSS. Adjust colors, layouts, and styling to match your preferences.

## Use Cases

AppleBlox works well for players who want to customize Roblox's appearance, developers who need to test with multiple instances, or anyone looking for more control over Roblox on Mac.
